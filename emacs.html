  <h2> Using emacs shortcuts for all sorts of stuff on Mac</h2>
  <br><br>

  <h4> Summary </h4>
  <div>
      Emacs shortcuts work (almost everywhere) in the Mac, as well as in bash,
      so it is good investment to learn them.
  </div>
  <br><br>

  <h4> Workflow is a very personal thing </h4>
  <div>
      <br>
      Most of the people I know are pretty opinionated on them.  Back in the
      day you use to have holy wars between emacs and vi users.  That's why I
      am pretty reluctant to use up my precious time writting htmls
      recommending stuff that you're not going to use anyway.  But in this 
      case the expected return seems to high to ignore it.

  <h4> Emacs style key bindings work in most places on OSX </h4>
  <div>
      Whenever you can input text in OSX, there are very high chances
      that emacs keybindings will work, enabling you to perform many
      basic text manipulation tasks such as 
      <br><br>
      <ul>
          <li> jump between words and lines </li>
          <li> jump to beginning of the line </li>
          <li> deleting last word or char without reaching out to delete, weirding out your pinkie </li>
          <li> hitting enter without moving your hand </li>
          <li> copy pasting the text </li>
          <li> swapping two last </li>
      </ul>

      <br><br>

      Additionally, most of the shortcuts do not require moving
      fingers a lot around the keyboard, shaving off these precious
      miliseconds you can later reuse for impressing your friends
      with your newely 

      <br><br>

      Opposed to fish shell, iTerm and similar stuff, 
      these shortcuts work out of the box on vast majority
      of bash unixey terminals, no installation. You can use it not only on your Mac,
      not only sshing to AWS, but also on your grandma's RedHat installation
      from 1998.

  <h4> Combos (warning, pros only) </h4>

      Whoa!
