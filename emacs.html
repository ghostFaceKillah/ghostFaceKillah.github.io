  <h2> Using emacs shortcuts for all sorts of stuff on Mac</h2>
  <br><br>

  <h4> Summary </h4>
  <div>
      Emacs shortcuts work (almost everywhere) in the Mac, as well as in bash,
      so it is good investment to learn them.
  </div>
  <br><br>

  <h4> Workflow is a very personal thing </h4>
  <div>
      <br>
      Most of the people I know are pretty opinionated on workflows and I am
      reluctant to try to convince anybody that something is better.
      But in this case the expected return seems to high to ignore it.
  </div>
  <br><br>

  <h4> Emacs style key bindings work in most places on OSX </h4>
  <div>
      Whenever you can input text in OSX, there are very high chances
      that emacs keybindings will work, enabling you to perform many
      basic text manipulation and movement tasks.

      <br><br>

      Additionally, most of the shortcuts do not require moving fingers a lot
      around the keyboard, which appeals to some people.  I like how it takes
      presure of my pinkie (by not pressing delete/backspace so much).

      <br><br>

      Opposed to fish shell, iTerm and similar stuff, 
      these shortcuts work out of the box on vast majority
      of bash unixey terminals, no installation. You can use it not only on your Mac,
      not only sshing to AWS, but also on your grandma's RedHat installation
      from 1998.
