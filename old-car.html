  <h2> How to build small self driving car? </h2>
  <br><br>

  <div>
      My recent side project is a small self driving car.
  </div>
  <br><br>

  <div id="first_pics">

  <br><br>


  <h4> Idea </h4>
  <div id="first_pics">
  <img src="img/car/how_it_works.jpg" style="max-width: 750px">
  </div>
  <br><br>


  <h3> Beginnings First car </h3>
  <div>
  Started the story with learning a bit about electronics.

  Discovered a great book:
  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Make-Electronics-Discovery-Charles-Platt/dp/0596153740">
  Make: electronics
  </a>.

  and learned a little bit about basic electronics.

  </div>
  <br><br>

  <div>
   Bought a little green car, disassembled it completely.
   I didn't understand too much about about how this stuff works, just bought
   the cheapest one in Action.nl.

  <img src="img/car/vanilla_green.jpg">
  <br><br>

  Deconstructed it looks like this.

  <img src="img/car/green_basic_deconstruct.jpg">
  <br><br>
    Actually construction of it is really simple, there are two wires
    going to battery, and two wires going to each engine front and back.

    <br><br>

  <br><br>


  <div>
      So we can easily figure out that 
     if we can control when electricty goes to the motor, we
    can control motor.
   
    We cannot drive the motor directly by raspi output pins though,
    as the current is too high.
    If we connected motor, it would damage raspi.

    You can buy motor controller for raspi or be thrifty, and implement own.
    I have chosen to follow
    <a href="https://business.tutsplus.com/tutorials/controlling-dc-motors-using-python-with-a-raspberry-pi--cms-20051">
    this tutorial
    </a> and it worked.
    <br><br>

    <img src="img/car/green_engine_controller.jpg">
    <br><br>
    Actually, I have learned soon that the tutorial contains a small error.
    Can't drive two motors as shown
    
    Read the chip factsheet, fixed the bug. 
    Can control car completely from raspi.

  <br><br>


  <h4> Construction </h4>
  <div>
      Implemented a basic remote control system that sends driving command
      over TCP socket.
      Not sure about how much power Rpi needs, bought a really big power pack
      for mobile phone.
      When it comes to joining stuff together, a lot of ziptie engineering. Thanks roadkill!

  <h4> Fail no - too heavy</h4>

      That one was way 2 heavy. Bought a way lighter battery with less capactiy.
      We were really lucky about the Pokemon Go craze, as it meant 
      a lot of cheap mobile battery packs.

  <h4> Camera </h4>
  <div>
      A lot of trial and error.

  <h4> Remote control </h4>
  <div>
    
    Remote control
    first tried TCP
    then tried UDP
  </div>
  <br><br>
    
  <h4> Second car </h4>
  <div>
    When I learned that the first one is too weak to transport all this weight,
    bought second stronger one. This one was 27 euro instead 5 euro.

    <br><br>
      <img src="img/car/black/black_vanilla.jpg">
    <br><br>

    I learned at this point that some of more advanced RC cars use more
    refined servo-style motor at front. These use PWM pulse width modulation
    and need a special hardware controller.
    

    <br><br>
      <img src="img/car/black/black_disassembly.jpg">
    <br><br>

    
    Luckily this one was not that expensive, 20-30 euro so still has simplified
    steering with linear engine driving the front wheel, as tested by most direct
    of methods.
    
    <br><br>
      <img src="img/car/black/black_disassembly_01.jpg">
    <br><br>

    Cleaned up the control module a bit and fit it into slightly
    tighter package.

    Added high quality camera holder.

  <h4> Machine learning</h4>
  <div>
      Idea was to do Nvidia paper, seen it used at Udacity
      self driving car nanodegree and in comma.ai paper.
  <br><br>

      Did a bit data gathering, 2 sessions of around hour.
      Started off with gathering one big track, around 10 meters
      around the whole house.
  <br><br>

      Trained a neural net like in the Nvidia paper.
  <br><br>

      It didn't work.

  <br><br>
      Then decided to simplify the problem to one turn.
      Gathered a lot of data another time.
  <br><br>

      Didn't work!

  <br><br>
      Annotated the data manually again to control for dynamic problems.

  <br><br>

      Still didn't work!

  <br><br>

    Cast to greyscale.

    Implemented data augmentation based on brigthness and contrast.
  <br><br>
    It worked.

  <h4> Lessons </h4>
  <div>
    
    * be patient and persistent
    * need a bit of money
