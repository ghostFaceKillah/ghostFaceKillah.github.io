General book reviews
====================

The Laws of Trading - Agustin Lebron
------------------------------------

4/5

* Overview of basics of "modern rules" of how to build HFT.
  Stuff like:
    * Know your edge aka "I don't want to be a member of any club that 
      wants me"
    * Alignment - great lessons for general life
* Reading this book is sus energy, reeks of financial - intellectual 
  voyeurism
* Naturally, it has to omit some _important topics_
* Reminiscent of Ricki Heicklen in Complex Systems podcast
* What is this guy's motivation ? Was he fired?
  Why did he choose to publicise this stuff?


Media Training Bible - Brad Phillips
------------------------------------

4/5

* Overview of how to talk in high publicity type of settings
* Rule number one: "Pivot and message"
  * Apparent in communication practiced by politicians both Polish and
    American
* Message has to be CUBE A
  * Consistent
  * Unburdend
  * Brief
  * Ear Worthy 
  * Audience-Focused



Why America is not New Rome, Vaclav Smil
---------------------------
