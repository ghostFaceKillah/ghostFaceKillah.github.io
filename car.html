  <h2> How to build small self driving car? </h2>
  <br><br>

  <div>
      My recent side project is a small self driving car.
  </div>

  <h4> Idea </h4>
  <div>
  A nice scheme how it workxx.
  Draw on ipad.
  </div>
  <br><br>


  <h3> Beginnings First car </h3>
  <div>
  Started the story with learning a bit about electronics.

  Discovered a great book:
  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Make-Electronics-Discovery-Charles-Platt/dp/0596153740">
  Make: electronics
  </a>.

  and learned a little bit about basic electronics.

  <br><br>

  <div>
   Bought a little green car, disassembled it completely.
   I didn't understand too much about about how this stuff works, just bought
   the cheapest one in Action.nl.

  <br><br>

  Deconstructed it looks like this.

  <img src="img/car/green_basic_deconstruct.jpg">
  <br><br>
    Actually construction of it is really simple, there are two wires
    going to battery, and two wires going to each engine front and back.

  <br><br>


  <div>
    So I have figured, if I can control when electricty goes to the motor, I
    can control motor. But it is not so easy, raspi can't run such
    high power through pins. If you connect motor, it will damage raspi
    You can buy motor controller for raspi or be thrifty, and implement own.
    Followed
    <a href="https://business.tutsplus.com/tutorials/controlling-dc-motors-using-python-with-a-raspberry-pi--cms-20051">
    this tutorial
    </a> and it worked! 
    <img src="img/car/green_engine_controller.jpg">
    
    Actually it contains an error.
    
    Read the chip factsheet, fixed the bug.

  <h4> Construction </h4>
  <div>
      Implemented a basic remote control system that sends driving command
      over TCP socket.
      Not sure about how much power Rpi needs, bought a really big power pack
      for mobile phone.
      When it comes to joining stuff together, a lot of ziptie engineering. Thanks roadkill!

      That one was way 2 heavy. Bought a way lighter battery with less capactiy.
      We were really lucky about the Pokemon Go craze, as it meant 
      a lot of cheap mobile battery packs.

  <h4> Remote control </h4>
  <div>
    
    Remote control
    first tried TCP
    then tried UDP
  </div>
  <br><br>
    
  <h4> Second car </h4>
  <div>
    When I learned that the first one is too weak to transport all this weight,
    bought second better one.
    
    I learned at this point that some of more advanced RC cars use more
    refined servo-style motor at front. These use PWM pulse width modulation
    and need a special hardware controller.
    
    Luckily this one was not that expensive, 20-30 euro so still has simplified
    steering with linear engine driving the front whel
    
    Remote control was too slow, fixed by buying faster intercae
