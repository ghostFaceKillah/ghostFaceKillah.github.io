     There once was a tiger-striped cat. This cat died a million deaths, 
  revived andlived a million lives, and he was owned by various people who he r
  eally didn't care for. The cat wasn't afraid to die. Then one day the cat 
  became a stray cat which meant he was free. He met a white female cat and
  the two of them spent their days together happily. Well, years passed and
  the white cat grew weak and died of old age. The tiger-striped cat cried 
  a million times, and then he died too.

  <h4> Except this time, he didn't come back to life. </h4>
